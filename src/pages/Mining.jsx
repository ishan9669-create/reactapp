While other remote sensing options such as satellite imagery provides you with about 30cm resolution data, we provide you with more than 10 times better resolution and accuracy. Conventional survey methods such as DGPS and TS takes more time in data collection as well as processing, while drone surveys help you realize at least 5x faster data delivery. Further, since the data is generated from actual imagery, it brings in better transparency.'

While 3D models and high resolution base map help in carrying out the initial survey required for quick planning and designing, drone videos with geotagged information can help in project monitoring and implementation. Further, once the base map of a city is prepared, it can then be integrated with cadastral maps and geospatial information to be leveraged for multiple applications such as property tax collection, large infrastructure development, solar rooftop potential estimation, roads & metro development and more.'

For greenfield projects, our quick topographic survey provides auhtorities with orthophoto, DTM, contur and cut fill estimation to carry out engineering design of the new highways. Drone videos help to quickly analyze the entire alignment both for designing purposes and traffic survey. Government boides such as MSRDC, NHAI, IHMCL and state government departments are the users of this technology.'
